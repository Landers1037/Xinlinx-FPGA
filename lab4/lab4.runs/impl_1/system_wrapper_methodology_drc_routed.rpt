2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-1#1 Warning
Clock Net has non-BUF driver and too many loads  
Clock net system_i/processing_system7_0/inst/FCLK_CLK0 is not driven by a Clock Buffer and has more than 512 loads. Driver(s): system_i/processing_system7_0/inst/PS7_i/FCLKCLK[0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.019 ns between system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/m01_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/SI_REG/r.r_pipe/m_payload_i_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/xbar/inst/gen_sasd.crossbar_sasd_0/reg_slice_r/m_payload_i_reg[12]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.365 ns between system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/m01_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/SI_REG/r.r_pipe/m_payload_i_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/xbar/inst/gen_sasd.crossbar_sasd_0/reg_slice_r/skid_buffer_reg[12]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.577 ns between system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/xbar/inst/gen_sasd.crossbar_sasd_0/m_atarget_enc_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/xbar/inst/gen_sasd.crossbar_sasd_0/reg_slice_r/m_payload_i_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
